# ShopProgram for pso2
Utilizes pyTesseract (unsure if Tesseract folder is needed in directory)\
Note: Coordinates hard coded to screensize, specific tab set-up required, scratch_banners.txt need to manually create.\
\
Might be improved by training model specific for pso2 font, dynamic coordinates or use pyautogui image click instead, update a csv file instead of tabbing to google spreadsheet
