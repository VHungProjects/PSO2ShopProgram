Utilizes pyTesseract ocr to read market prices and enters the numbers into a premade spreadsheet (unsure if Tesseract folder is needed in directory)\
Note: Coordinates hard coded to screensize, specific tab set-up required, scratch_banners.txt need to manually create.\

Very basic and discontinued
- Use SQL and load values into SQL rather than alt tabbing to google sheets (For both names and prices) Gets rid of switching screens
- Some web scrapper to get names of scratch items instead of manually getting them
- Probably could use libraries more efficiently
